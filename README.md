# Obsidian plugin development

This is an **unofficial** documentation page for Obsidian plugin development.

**Disclaimer:** I'm **not** affiliated with Obsidian. I learn by writing and documenting, so this is my way of learning how to build plugins myself. I'll improve the documentation as I learn more, but feel free to contribute if you see something missing or wrong.
