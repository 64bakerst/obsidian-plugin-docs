# Plugin development for Obsidian

This is an **unofficial** documentation page for Obsidian plugin development.

If this site doesn't help you, maybe one of these resources might:

**Official resources by the Obsidian team:**

- [Obsidian Sample Plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin)
- [Obsidian API](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api)

**Unofficial resources by community members:**

- [Plugins mini FAQ](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/plugins-mini-faq/7737)
- [Create Your Own Obsidian Plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lA-jaMNS0k) by Antone Heyward
- [Unofficial API FAQ](https://liamca.in/Obsidian/API+FAQ/index) by Liam Cain
- [Obsidian Tools](https://github.com/obsidian-tools/obsidian-tools)

:::warning Disclaimer
I'm **not** affiliated with Obsidian. I learn by writing and documenting, so this is my way of learning how to build plugins myself. I'll improve the documentation as I learn more, but feel free to contribute if you see something missing or wrong.
