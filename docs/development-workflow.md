# Development workflow

Whenever you make a change to the plugin source code, the plugin needs to be reloaded. You can reload the plugin by quitting Obsidian and starting it again, but that quickly gets tiring.

## Re-enable plugin inside Obsidian

To re-enable the plugin from within Obsidian:

1. Open **Preferences**
1. Click **Community plugins**
1. Find your plugin under **Installed plugins**
1. Toggle the switch off to disable the plugin
1. Toggle the switch on to enable the plugin

You're now running the updated version of your plugin.

## Reload on file changes

The [Hot-Reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) plugin reloads your plugin whenever the source code changes.
